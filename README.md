# Todo Page
This is the _main_ page of the TodoPal application.

It's a microfrontend application, so it is not meant to be used alone.

## Setup
For local development follow these steps:

Install the dependencies, then start the application with the following command:
```
npm run serve:single-spa:todo-page
```
